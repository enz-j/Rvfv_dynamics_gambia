# Rvfv_dynamics_gambia
Our study addresses a key gap in Rift Valley fever epidemiology in the West African Sahel, where transmission remains poorly understood. We develop deterministic and stochastic models to assess RVF virus dynamics in transhumant cattle, offering insights into disease persistence, livestock management, zoonotic risk, and control strategies.
